## Make Your Own Theme?

Would like to make your own theme on top of these themes? It's quite easy, only a few steps are needed:

### Step 1: Get the files

To get the files, you can fork & clone the repository to your computer.

Alternatively, you can open the templates' Overleaf webpages and click `Open as Template`.

### Step 2: Replace icon pictures

The `images/` folder stores the icon pictures. The `SINTEF_Logo_Sentrert_RGB.jpg` is the icon picture shown on the title page & normal pages. And the `SINTEF_Logo_Sentrert_Negativ_RGB.jpg` is the icon picture shown on the contents pages & end page, both on the left-top corner.

You can replace them with your own icons, noted that the pictures' file names should be the same as the original ones, otherwise the theme doesn't know how to find your icons.

For those who open the template on Overleaf, please click the `Upload` button on the top-left corner to upload your icon pictures, and replace the original icon files in the `images/` folder.

### Step 3: Replace background picture

The `images/` folder also stores the background picture, which is `background.png`. You can fell free to replace it in the same way as Step 2.

### Step 4: Change the main colour

To optimize the visual appearance, it's recommended to change the main colour, which will be used as the colour of titles and backgrounds. The 7-th line of `sintefcolor.sty` file defines the main colour:
```
\definecolor{sintefblue}{RGB}{148,0,64}
```
Assuming that the RGB value of the new main colour is `(254, 191, 75)`, just rewrite the last 3 values in the code as:
```
\definecolor{sintefblue}{RGB}{254, 191, 75}
```
Now you have your brand new template üëèüéâ
