abstract: "In view of the problems existing in biomedical engineering education, such as the lack of pertinence, disconnection from the needs of the industry and lack of a perfect teaching experimental platform and data system, this paper puts forward a biomedical engineering experimental teaching system for the demand of the industry. The whole process with fine refinement and high efficiency for the biomedical engineering experimental teaching is provided by constructing the experimental teaching platform with the “Three-in-one” integration of the experimental equipment, experimental teaching materials and video resources. The system has the characteristics of modularization, and standardization, and combines closely with the leading-edge concepts of the industry, teaching and research practice, achieving good teaching practice effect and positive feedback."
