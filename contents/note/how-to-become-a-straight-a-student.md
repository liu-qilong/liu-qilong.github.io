## Part III: Essays and Papers

In part 3, Cal devises a detail scheme to approach thesis/essay assignments. I got 3 takeaways that not only could help my academic writing but may also be applicable to research works:

- _Split the mentally demanding tasks into steps._ Intertwining thesis/arguments construction, writing, and supporting sources-hunt is a nightmare cuz it's extremely tiring and puts you to the state of frequent context-shipping, leading to low efficiency and low quality.
- _Seek feedback from social resources_. Seeking feedbacks from Prof. and trusted peers is crucial - unless you'd already be an expert on the field.
- _Serious editing_. Cal devises a serious 3-passes editing scheme that centers on presenting the material you've written in different forms, i.e. in printed & audio forms, which makes neglected mistakes more notable.

- Step 1: Target a Titillating Topic
- Step 2: Conduct a Thesis-Hunting Expedition
- Step 3: Seek a Second Opinion
- Step 4: Research like a Machine
- Step 5: Craft a Powerful Story
- Step 6: Consult Your Expert Panel
- Step 7: Write Without the Agony
- Step 8: Fix, Don’t Fixate
- The Plan in Action
