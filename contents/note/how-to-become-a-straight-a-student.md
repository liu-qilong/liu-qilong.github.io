In part 3, Cal devises a detail scheme to approach thesis/essay assignments. I got 3 takeaways that not only could help my academic writing but may also be applicable to research works:

- _Split the mentally demanding tasks into steps._ Intertwining thesis/arguments construction, writing, and supporting sources-hunt is a nightmare cuz it's extremely tiring and puts you to the state of frequent context-shipping, leading to low efficiency and low quality.
- _Seek feedback from social resources_. Seeking feedbacks from Prof. and trusted peers is crucial - unless you'd already be an expert on the field.
- _Serious editing_. Cal devises a serious 3-passes editing scheme that centers on presenting the material you've written in different forms, i.e. in printed & audio forms, which makes neglected mistakes more notable.
