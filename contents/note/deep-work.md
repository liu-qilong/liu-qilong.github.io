# Deep Work | Cal Newport

## Part I: The Idea

### Deep Work Is Valuable

- 3 types who thrived in the new economy: high-skilled workers/super stars/owners.
- How to thrive in the new economy: quickly master hard things & produce at elite level.
- Deep work & deliberate practice: intense concentration & feedbacks towards productivity.
    Reasoning: myelin & attention residue & law of productivity.
- Exception: Jack Dorseyâ€™s case.

### Deep Work Is Rare

Why hard works is rare:

- Deep work is hard and shallow work is easier.
- The _metric black hole_: hard to measure different knowledge work behavior's actual impact on the bottom line (outcome)
- "The Internet" technopoly culture that believes whatever the IT revolution provides are revolutionarily good.

### Deep Work Is Meaningful

- Neurologically, as Winifred Gallagher discovered, our brain construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. Deep work requires concentration and thus it both focuses your _worldview_ to your deep endeavor and filters out those unavoidable unpleasant things. Shallow work, instead, have exactly the opposite effect.
- Psychologically, as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi researched, going deep is a rewarding feeling since it's well suited to generate flow state.
- Philosophically, as Hubert Dreyfus wrote, craftsmanship (any pursuit that supports high-level of skill) cultivates the appreciation of the subtlety which is crucial for someone to find meaning in a post-Enlightenment world - a glimpse of sacred.

## Part 2: The Rules


### Rule #1 Work Deeply

By reading Part 1, you may have developed the attempts to bring more depth to your work. However, simply telling yourself that you will do it is not enough - human's will power is a limited resources and thus fighting the urge towards shallowness needs solidified philosophy & habits.

- Depth philosophy
    - Monastic philosophy
        Radically exclude yourself from correspondence and focus on the deep work. Suitable for those whose contribution to the world is discrete, clear, and individualized.
        e.g. Donald Knuth & Neal Stephenson.
    - Bimodal philosophy
        Shift between monastic mode and socially available mode during different periods (lasting from days to months).
        e.g. Carl Jung & Adam Grant.
    - Rhythmic philosophy
        Schedule deep works as a daily routine to boost the consistency. Use _chain method_ (marking the completions of the routine on your calendar) as a stimuli.
        e.g. Jerry Seinfeld & Brain Chappell.
    - Journalistic philosophy
        Squeeze the spare time to conduct deep works. Be careful though, the constant context shifting may tires you faster.
        e.g. Walter Isaacson.
- Strategies
    - Ritualize
        Ritualize the place you work, the time you work, the way you kick start your work, and the support you get for your work. The purpose is to help yourself committing to the work _seriously_.
        One extreme of this advise is to make _grand gestures_, like lock yourself to a distant places/luxury hotel room to work. e.g. Bill Gates' _Think Weeks_.
    - 4DX framework
        The 4DX framework is initially proposed for guiding business executive. The author found it very useful for deep work too:
        - Focus on the wildly important
            Doing more means complete less. Only focus on the most important things.
        - Act on the _lead measure_
            Instead on optimizing the lag measure, i.e. the final outcome interested, optimize the lead measure that leads to a satisfied outcome.
        - Keep a compelling scoreboard
        - Create a cadence of accountability
            For a organization, this means a form of meeting. For individuals, this can be implemented as the _weekly review_.
    - Be lazy after shutting down work
        Idleness is vital for work performance since only during it you can restore your attention and energy. More over, your brain is still processing information unconsciously during idleness, which is a state shown to outperform deliberate thinking for the vague, conflicting, information demanding decision tasks.
        - [Shutdown rituals](https://qilong-liu.vercel.app/blog/cal-newport-time-management)
            To ensure true relaxation after working, you need to log all your thoughts firing in your brain to a task/idea tracking system, to avoid the Zeigarnik effect.
    - Deep works with collaborators
        Serendipitous communication can boost creativity, but it can't replace deep work. You need to be able to shift from these two domains purposefully. In the most ideal cases, you can combined the benefits of the two - the _white board effect_, i.e. working together with a shared white board which push both of you into a deeper state.

### Rule #2 Embrace Boredom

The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill to be _trained_.

- _Take breaks from distraction_ won't work, because your brain is distracted most of the time. Instead, we should _take breaks from focus_, to help your brain get used to the low-stimuli/high-value activities.
    - Schedule internet block & offline block. The key is when you need Internet access during the offline block, you can reschedule an Internet block _at least 5 min later_ (for the matter of brain training).
    - Roosevelt dash
        Set dashing DDL to force you to work with intense focus, like what Teddy Roosevelt did.
- Meditate productively
    Think deeply on a well-defined problem when you are physically occupied by walking, running, etc. Bring your attention back whenever it wanders. It's beneficial to structure your deep thinking to 3 steps:
    - Review relevant variables
    - Define specific next-step question
    - Review and consolidate your gains
- Memorize a deck of cards
    Human brains is not good at memorizing abstract information, but very good at remembering scenes. The memorization champions utilize this reality and engineer an approach for memorization, which is great for training your ability to _focus_ - the ability the world-class mental athletes are actually training.
    - Memorizing 5 rooms, and for each room memorizing 10 objects. Add 2 extract objects to the list. Then training yourself to do mental walkthrough these rooms and objects in order.
    - Associate the 52 cards with memorable persons.
    - When memorizing a freshly shuffled cards, do the metal walkthrough and image the person associated with the cards interacting with the objects, one by one.

### Rule #3 Quit Social Media

- On tool chosen
    When deciding whether to use social media or not, as well as other tools in general, there are two mindsets: the _any-benefit mindset_ selects whichever tool with some benefit, while the _craftsman approach_ carefully calculates the _opportunity costs_ and only select those provides more benefits than its costs.
    - The law of the vital few
        The calculation of benefits and costs should be restricted to only considering its impact on a _limited_ list of your _main goals ($n \leq 3$)_ and main _key activities ($n \leq 3$)_. Only the most important activities should be included, since the allocation of attention is a _zero-sum game_.
- Quit social media
    Based on this mindset, for most people, quitting social could be a good choice, cuz usually you don't need social media to do your deep work and pursuit your grand goals. In fact, social media can fragment your attention severely since they are profitable products designed to be additive.
    - The feeling of having an group of audience is an illusion - in fact, most of them don't care that much. More over, the anxiety of not catching up is unnecessary. You can verify this by quitting social media for 30 days.
    - Don't use Internet to entertain yourself cuz it could easily stuff your limited free time with digital crab. Offer yourself something deep and meaningful as an alternative.

### Rule #4 Drain the Shallows

- **Quantify the depth of every activity**
    It's hard to quantify the depth of a task. There's rarely a task that completely irrelevant to the end outcome; yet only a limited number of tasks has depth.
    Luckily, a more _clear_ metric exists: **how many months of training it takes for a college graduate to learn how to do it**.
    E.g. editing academic paper is much deeper than attending progress meeting or composing stats slides.
- Schedule every minute of your day: [Time blocks](https://qilong-liu.vercel.app/blog/cal-newport-time-management)
    The purpose is not stick to the plan minute by minute, but instead let you _thoughtfully_ arrange what you do next and maintain the balance between _deep_ and _shallow_ works. Introduce structure into your life is for facilitating _depth_.
    - Fixed schedule productivity
        Setting _hard limit_ on finish your work by 17:30 won't harm your productivity if you consider working proposal with (ruthless) caution and rejects shallow obligations - this may even be a motivation for you to do so and end up with more _deep_ work time.
        Noted that when refusing proposal, a _clear break_ is the bset.
        e.g. Professor "Tom" v.s. Prof. Radhika Nagpal.
- Become hard to reach
    - Sender filters
        Make people who send you email do more work. In your contact page, reset the senders' expectation and add more work to them like providing a Google Form to fill, etc.
    - Process centric approach in reply
        Do more work when reply: compose a comprehensive review of motivation, status, availability, etc. to minimize the _back-and-forth_ messages - to _close the loop_.
    - If the email doesn't worth it to respond, don't respond.
- Ask your boos for a shallow budget
    Have an conversation with your boss and convince him that paying you to do more _deep_ work worth more. Your boss's words can then be leveraged to protect your from _shallow_ obligations from your working environment - which may drain your working time if your adopt the traditional _guilt-driven unconditional acceptance_ approach otherwise.
