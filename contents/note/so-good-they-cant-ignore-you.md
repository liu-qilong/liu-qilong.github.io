## Rule #2 Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You

- [x] The Clarity of the Craftsman
- [x] The Power of Career Capital
- [x] The Career Capitalists
- [x] Becoming a Craftsman

5 steps to start becoming a craftsman who accumulates _career capital_ with _deliberate practice_:

- _Decide what capital market you're in_. I'm in academia. To win good positions, the only capital is _good publications_. Therefore, this is a _winner-take-all_ marker.
- _Identify your capital type_. _Good publication_ is the major capital in the academic market. To gain this kind of capital, critical skills to master include grand vision of the field (e.g. keeping tracking of up-to-date papers), ability to hunt down important-impactful-manageable problems, theoretical and practical skills (e.g. math and programming), and good writing & presentation skills.
- _Define "good"_. The gold standard of _good_ is the ranking of the journal or conference. For senior positions, citation number also matters.
- _Stretch and destroy_. For the _stretch_ part, to accumulate career capital, I have been polishing my skills via learning intensely and in balance. However, the time devotion for developing practical skills and pushing real research projects towards publications is insufficient. This is the first drawback I need to tackle. For the _destroy_ part, in academia, feedbacks mainly come from team meetings and peer review. To facilitate my ability for problem hunt, I might need to try to actively seeking advice from my peers.
- _Be patient_. Sure I will be patient. At least my RA job can offer my daily expenses and keep me in the academic world where I can keep accumulating my career capital. Just stay deep!


## Rule #3 Turn Down a Promotion

After developing the concept of _career capital_, and traits that can be bought with career capital to make good job good, Cal moves to two specific traits: _control_ and _mission_.

Ordinary 9-5 works don't provide a lot of _control_. To jump out of this situation, you need career capital, which needs to be validated by _financial validation_, i.e. you still get enough money after getting the control you want, no matter via which form. For academic job, everybody seems to has a full-load of control; **yet in reality, when in tenure track, you got to stick to the most secured research direction and the most grinding work-schedule if you are not one of the top-tier stars**. That's an important message for me.

## Rule #4 Think Small, Act Big

For _mission_, Cal argues that only those who has acquired a through understanding can find a really compelling mission (_adjacent possibility_), and only these people can practically tracing them and derive _remarkable_ works. Therefore, career capital is vital for a good mission. In tracing the mission, _little bets_ is a good strategy; whereas in making them remarkable, the _remark-ability_ (why people care & spread it) and the _venue_ for marketing are crucial.
