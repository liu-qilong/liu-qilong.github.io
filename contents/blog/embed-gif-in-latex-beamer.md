As an research postgraduate student, I frequently make "academic-looking" slides for meetings, which comprise a lot of references, tables, charts, and sometimes math equations. LaTeX is excellent for typesetting these elements, so using LaTeX to make slides sounds like a good idea.

With tutorials like [Beamer - Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer), I got started with this approach and feel more and more comfortable. I even made a series of templates for me and my friends (for more details: [Beamer-LaTeX-Themes](/project/beamer-latex)). Here are some example pages:

However, LaTeX only generates PDF files, which are usually static. Excluding videos and GIFs completely from your presentation? How pitiful. I searched the internet for a while and eventually found a simple workflow to embed GIFs in LaTeX beamer [^1].

[^1]: This workflow was inspired by: [Getting GIF and/or moving images into a LaTeX presentation - StackExchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/240243/getting-gif-and-or-moving-images-into-a-latex-presentation)

## Convert `gif`/`mp4` to `png` series

Firstly, use the command-line tool to convert `.gif`/`.mp4` to a series of `.png`:
```
magick convert -coalesce <>.gif <>.png
magick convert -coalesce <>.mp4 <>.png
```

_P.S. If the folder only have one gif/mp4 and the desired output image name is `fig-<>.png`:_
```
magick convert -coalesce *.gif fig.png
magick convert -coalesce *.mp4 fig.png
```

_P.S. If you want to index the figures with 3 (or more) digits, such as `fig001.png`, you can revised the command as:_
```
magick convert -coalesce *.gif fig%3d.png
```

_P.S. When converting other files to `.gif`, if you want it to loop for infinity times, add option `-loop 0`._

## Embedded them to the beamer

And then add the series of `.png` as dynamic images in beamer using the `animate` package:
```
\usepackage{animate}
...
\animategraphics[loop, autoplay, controls, width=\textwidth]{10}{images/test/test-}{0}{16}
```

_P.S. Sometimes format conversion, batch cropping, and resizing of videos/images are also needed. Following is some useful materials:_

## Recommended PDF reader

The generated PDF file can be displayed in [Acrobat Reader](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pdf-reader.html) or [Foxit Reader](https://www.foxit.com). However, when in full-screen slideshow mode (on MacBook ðŸ’» ), the previous one gets blurred and the latter one has a white margin.

Eventually, I found that the best way to display slideshow was:
- Open the generated `.pdf` with with [Acrobat Reader](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pdf-reader.html).
- `Acrobat Reader - Preference - General` uncheck `Open documents as new tabs in the same window`.
- `View - Page Display - Single Page View`.
- Use the `read mode` by pressing `âŒƒ + âŒ˜ + H` and then press `âŒƒ + âŒ˜ + F` to enter MacOS's full screen mode.
