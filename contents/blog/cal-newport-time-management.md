# Cal Newport's time management system

> [Cal Newport]()'s time management system is summarized in [The Time-Block Planner - Cal Newport](https://www.timeblockplanner.com). Combining the techniques discussed in this tiny pamphlet and his other books/podcasts, I compiled this blog post.

## Core value of time management 💡

Cal Newport advocates his time management system in his [books]((https://calnewport.com/writing/)) and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CalNewportMedia). It's both time-efficient, lightweight, and deliver the most important values of any time management system:

- Time management _frees your mental stress_ on remembering all the todos & dues bouncing around your head.
- Time management has you _articulately_ think about how can you complete your tasks in time. By doing this, you will soon realize that the task is more complicated than your expectation and you don't have so many allocable time, which boost motivation.
  _e.g. Think about [PhD application](). If you got 1 year to do it, it seems that you can do it in a leisure pace. However, if you think about the checkpoints of this task articulately, you may realize that you'd better launch your work this week!_

## Time blocking 🕰️

### Two-column todo list

Every day has two column: _tasks_ and _ideas_.

- When some random ideas come to you, don't distract from what you are doing at the moment - just drop them to the _ideas_ column.
- At the beginning of each day, transfer the _ideas_ to the _tasks_ column of the day you'd like to address it.
- At the beginning of each day, schedule the _tasks_ assigned to this day or transfer it to another day. Marks the specific time for each task.

### Time blocks

- Visualize the time arrangement of the tasks as time blocks.
- If plans are changed, draw it visually in the time block view.

### Shutdown rituals

At the end of working time, transfer all _working memory_ (ideas, materials, and so on) to a file so that they won't be bouncing around the brain. Enjoys a good leisure time 🍸.

## Metric tracking 📊
