[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is an excellent tool for documenting Python projects. It can generate comprehensive documentation from [docstrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring#:~:text=In%20programming%2C%20a%20docstring%20is,a%20specific%20segment%20of%20code.) in the code, which means that the comments you write for your code also serve as its documentation.

If you are not familiar with writing docstrings or Sphinx documentation, I highly recommend checking out this tutorial:

> [A “How to” Guide for Sphinx + ReadTheDocs - sglvladi](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

My workflow was adapted from this tutorial with some personalization. Here is an example:

![example](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*6aMCqs93yP1FzGm7Dr-8Mw.png)

## Folder structure and setup

Under the root folder of the project, there are `docs/` for storing documentation, `<projectname>/` folder for storing program files, and auxiliary files including `.gitignore`, `LICENSE.md`, `README.md`, and `requirement.txt`.

_P.S. Don't forget to ignore `docs/build/` via `.gitignore` before committing to the repository._

At `docs/`, run

```
sphinx-quickstart
```

with option “separated `source/` and `build/` directories”.

## Files and configuration

### Edit `docs/source/conf.py`

Include program path:

```
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))
```

_P.S. With this setting, in the sub-module codes, other sub-module should be imported in this way: `from <project-modle> import <sub-module>`. Otherwise, errors may be thrown when building documentation._

Include extensions:

```
extensions = [
	'sphinx.ext.duration',
	'sphinx.ext.doctest',
	'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
	'sphinx.ext.autosummary',
	'sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram',
	'sphinx.ext.napoleon',
	'sphinx.ext.viewcode',
	'sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel',
	'sphinx_copybutton',
	'myst_parser',
]

source_suffix = {
	'.rst': 'restructuredtext',
	'.txt': 'markdown',
	'.md': 'markdown',
}

autosummary_generate = True
autodoc_member_order = 'bysource'
```

_P.S. Here we use the `sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram` to generate inheritance diagram. It requires install `graphviz` package via `homebrew`:_
> [Homebrew Documentation - Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)

> [Failed to connect to raw.githubusercontent.com:443 - CaptainOfPhB]()

> [Install graphviz on Mac OSX - Graphviz](https://macappstore.org/graphviz/)_

Change theme template:

```
html_theme = 'furo'
html_logo = 'logo_tob.png'

html_context = {
	"display_github": True,
	"github_user": "TOB-KNPOB",
	"github_repo": "Jabref2Obsdian",
	"github_version": "main",
	"conf_py_path": "/docs/",
}
```

Noted that the `logo.png` should be placed in `docs/source/`.

### Add `autosummary` templates

By default, all classes in a module are presented in the same page. However, it usually results in a giant webpage which is very hard to read. In this case, my preference are separated pages for different classes. This feature was realized based on this StackOverflow answer:

> [Sphinx autodoc is not automatic enough - StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62613202).

You can find the template files you need here:

- [custom-class-template.rst](https://github.com/TOB-KNPOB/pedarProbe/blob/main/docs/source/_templates/custom-class-template.rst)
- [custom-module-template.rst](https://github.com/TOB-KNPOB/pedarProbe/blob/main/docs/source/_templates/custom-module-template.rst)

Place them in the `docs/source/_templates/` folder.

### Insert `autosummary` directives

Include the `autosummary` directives like below in a documentation page, e.g. `api.rst`, the whole documentation will be generated:

```
.. autosummary::
	:toctree: _autosummary
	:template: custom-module-template.rst
	:recursive:
	
	<projectname>
```

Then include the `api.rst` in the index page `index.rst`:

```
.. toctree::
	:maxdepth: 100
	:caption: Table of Contents:
	
	api
```

_P.S. Don't forget to include the repository link in `index.rst` for the readers' reference._

## Generate the documentation

Generate web pages:

```
make html
```

Generate LaTeX manual:

```
make latex
cd build/latex
make
```

_P.S. If the documentation contains Chinese symbols, the second `make` command will not be implemented successfully. In this case, we need to place `\usepackage{xeCJK}` in the preamble and typeset it via `XeLaTeX` engine._

## Publish to Read The Docs

Before set up a build on [Read The Docs](http://readthedocs.org), `requirements.txt` is needed to be properly set:

- The path to `requirements.txt` is needed to be specified via `RTD Project Page - Admin - Advanced Settings - Requirements file`. The path should be relative to the repository's root folder.
- Inbuilt packages of Python and Sphinx are not needed to be included in `requirements.txt`.

In my case, the `:

```
# python packages
...

# jupyter notebook
ipykernel
nbconvert

# sphinx packages
sphinx_copybutton
myst_parser
furo
```

_P.S. Under the hood, when building your documentation, RTD runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download all dependencies of your project. This is also a good way to set up the dependencies in your local machine (usually in a newly set up virtual environment)._
